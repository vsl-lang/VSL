 * is a subclass of this), so you might not need a subclass of this.
 *
 * Subclassing is easy, check the API, but the most likely method you want to
 * override is `receivedNode` which gets the parent, and name, you can get the
 * node then using `parent[name]`. Both values are passed as if the node is
 * changed you can still obtain a reference to it. Again, it's reccomended to
 * try to use `ASTTool` and modify your transformations before creating a
 * traverser objects as the queue generation is blocking and GC iterations can
 * be slow as they need to iterate yet again.
