/*
 * wait we don't have let or var yet, so we need to add those and final and const now?
 * I guess
 * so agreed syntax is (let|var|final|const) name [: type] = expr;?
 * Ok i have two suggestion:
 *   1. let is implicit strict type and var is like loose type
 *   2. let & var are aliases, and `:=` is implicit strict type
 *   hmm if we make let strict type then we have := free meaning good thing
 *   ok
