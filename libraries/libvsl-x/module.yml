# Don't change this otherwise you'll have an infinite loop of stdlib loading the
# stdlib. Yes, there is infinite loop protection but not for the stdlib because
# why would you remove this. If you can provide me a half-decent reason for why
# it should exist I'll add it but that reason does not exist.
nostdlib: true

# Specify that this is library (i.e. not an executable)
# Dynamic library because it doesn't make sense for each VSL proc to launch its
# own copy of the STL
target: dynamic

# One-depth wildcard can be used but this also serves as an example module.ymlPath
# and you usually in 99% of cases want a recursive vsl source path
